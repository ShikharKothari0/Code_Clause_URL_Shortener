# Code_Clause_URL_Shortener
 This is a java project created by me during my internship at CodeClause. This application shortens a given URL into a smaller URL and stores bothe of them in<br> a HashMap and can retrieve the original URL when provided with the shortened URL.<br>
In this program we are provided with a GUI which provides us with the following:<br>
<ul><li>URL_TextField - Here we have to enter the URL(Original or Shortened as per our need)</li><li>ShortenButton - This Button is used to Shorten the URL provided in the URL_TextField</li><li>ExtendButton - This Button is used to Retrieve the Original URL for the shortened URL  provided in the URL_TextField</li></ul><br><br>
This program works by creating a shortcode for the given url and then storing the shortcode with the original URL in a Global HashMapthatcan be later accessed to retrieve the original URL on providing the program with the respective short code.
